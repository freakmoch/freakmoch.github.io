Sometime's days are hard to get through,
And its seems like its always a chore
Everything seems to pile up
And you feel you can't take anymore

But theres no need to worry
You're doing your best, I know
As time keeps on going
You yourself will continue to grow

So I want to tell you right now
As your worrying days go by
Take everything that bothers you
And walk through them one step at a time.

Breathe a little deeper
When it feels like you're in a rut
Weigh your options carfully, but remember:
It is you who needs to be unstuck.

Do not let those who weigh you down
Pull you from your own flight in life
Keep breathing, and clouds of doubt will dissipate
For your futures sure in sight.

And if it feels like lifes constantly a storm
That seems to never ever let up
Know that cloudy days can't last forever
And surely the sun will come out.

Know that your future is your own
So take life from the reigns
But if the road seems a little rough
Take your time to self-explain.

If theres anything you should takeaway
From reading this poem today:
Know "There's no need to be in a rush dear,
Cuz there's always time to sing in the rain."
