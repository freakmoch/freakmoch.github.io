Subject: A Complex Thought   
Thu May 13, 2010 11:26 am

I've had some time to think as of late.
And I'd like to share one of these ideas.
Collect common opinion, and interpretation.


Base 1:
Concept of thought.

I've started to slowly try and visualize my thought process. A complex endeavor indeed. But, I have a type of explanation. Think spherically, that the life functions are inside of this collective and protected core. The center of existence. And around that are paths, steel bars if you will. Of common thought patterns. One thought leads to another and another. Memories arrange in line.
A thought, a single idea is like a small orb on each of these paths. Overall, there is a massive array of 'thought path webbing' and an unfathomable amount of tiny dots all moving. Your mind is capable of separating, and listing by priority. And your attention, is like a cone of light. What you're 'thinking of' as a conscious thought, is illuminated and 'zoomed in on' by this cone of light.

Base 2:
Focus.

If one is to focus exclusively upon one thought or idea, a dot of thought, (Generally the amount of focus in a sober state of mind isn't extensive nor exclusive) one can discover an entire world of related thoughts inside of that one. A thought web of its own. And, if one can comprehend that, focusing deeper into a thought may produce another world of thoughts inside of that. Effectively, its the idea of infinite divisibility applied to the concept of human perception and thought.

Base 3:
Macro-Existence.

This, is where things get a little touchy, and difficult to understand.
Take the concept of infinite divisibility, and reverse it. I refer to it as macro-ing. 
If one can separate cells into atoms, and atoms into quarks.
The reverse is effectively the same steps, but hasn't been defined past a certain point.
The Atom is Macro-ed to the Cell, the Cell Macro-ed to the cell type, which makes up the organism, which is the macro, to an extent of the atom.
Now, take this concept and apply it to human thought.

A Macro of such a thing would be a unified thought between multiple people. Or all people.

There are recorded cases of people using certain drugs. (Told you it gets touchy) That trip them all through the same experience, the same place, the same grand entity. And these apparently coincide with recorded near-death or post-death resurrection stories. If these stories fit correctly, the way I'm thinking they might, it could be the macro step.

Everything can be infinitely macro-ed, based on the reverse concept of infinite divisibility, this rings truer and truer with the belief that space is infinite. That there is an infinite, limitless, expanse of possibilities in the dark sheet that wraps around our tiny, mostly blue planet. Frightening as it may be, scientists claim it now, but we are very short sighted as far as the expanses of space.

Now, Macro-ing applied to human consciousness and thought. A step would be a unification of thought between two people, which could influence and share each others... well.. everything. Memories, emotions, even physical reception of feelings. I.E. The brain interprets pain or pleasure.
And included in this is the perception of environment.

Now, lets think a greater macro.
Step back again, every human has an orb of thought. Its own core, its own thoughts.
Macro out, and you find that each orb of human thought is simply a dot on a larger web.
Its a grand concept, that there is a core, about all of us. Society, humankind, or otherwise.

Through this concept. Would our macro be what some consider God?
Continuously, all knowing?

And, if one sees this as a view of God, what then, is the macro of that?
